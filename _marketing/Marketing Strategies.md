## Marketing for the NOW

#### Original video content ^video
Everyone has the time to watch an engaging two or three-minute video about a solution that might be of value to them.
- Great stories
- Fun videos
- Useful content - avalon youtube, zerodha blog
- Client testimonials
- Animated infographics - use in email
- Animated explainers
- Webinars

#### Influencer marketing ^influencer
Partnering with influencers, who have loyal following, to up their credibility and social media reach. 
Eg: Smallcase and shashank.
- Identify target buyers - develop buyer personas, their goals, content they prefer
- Determine industry influencers -  identify the peers, bloggers, publications that your target buyers are following
- Build social credibility - blog posts, webinars are critical for laying the foundation to get influencers on board.

#### High value content
- Tell better stories - documentary of a customer’s journey, a powerful interview or a day-in-the-life of an employee helping customers solve challenges.
- Personalize for each stakeholder - building a persona
- Centralize your content experience - “Resources” page on your website - can funnel leads
- Deliver real value - brand impression
- Make unique content for diff scenarios - entertain, educate, inspire, convince

> The Rule of Reciprocity - Eventually, the more value you provide, the more prospects will rely on you for high-value content and give you their time in return.


#### Marketing Automation tools
Automated systems for collecting leads, building a marketing pipeline, segmenting contacts, and marketing to them on a consistent (and intelligent) basis.
- Automation - mails can be scheduled to be sent automatically - welcome, transaction details mail.
- Lead scoring - each interaction with a prospect can attribute points to them. Open an email: 5, click a link:10.
- Segmentation - leveraging data to target prospects with information most relevant to them.

#### Existing customer re-marketing
- Customer portals - user logs in, information hub - announce new products, alert them to live events, ask for suggestions
- Customer communities - upselling new products, beta testing. eg: obsidian - feature reqs, solve other user's problems

#### Marketing Channels for Existing Customers
- Important because they can minimize churn rate and reduce the need for new customer acquisition tactics which puts pressure on top of the marketing funnel.
- Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) segmentation method.
- Happy customers become brand ambassadors.
- User-generated content. Any marketing message that can be pulled from the community, is savings on marketing budget.
